| `ping`                                 | Used to test the connectivity between the local machine and remote systems. |
| `trace`                                | A network diagnostic tool used to trace the route packets take to a remote host. |

# **How to Set Permanent Static IP on Linux**

To configure a permanent static IP on Linux systems, you need to modify network configuration files. Below are the methods for different Linux distributions to make the changes persistent across reboots.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Permanent Static IP on Ubuntu/Debian (with Netplan)**

In Ubuntu 18.04 and later, `netplan` is used for network configuration.

### **Steps to Set Permanent Static IP:**

1. **Edit the Netplan configuration file:**
   Netplan configuration files are located in `/etc/netplan/`. Edit one of the files:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
   ```

2. **Configure Static IP:**
   Add the following configuration to set a static IP:
   ```yaml
   network:
     version: 2
     renderer: networkd
     ethernets:
       eth0:
         dhcp4: no        # Disable DHCP
         addresses:
           - 192.168.1.10/24  # Set static IP
         gateway4: 192.168.1.1  # Set Gateway
         nameservers:
           addresses:
             - 8.8.8.8         # Set DNS
             - 8.8.4.4
   ```

3. **Apply Changes:**
   Save the file and apply the changes:
   ```sh
   sudo netplan apply
   ```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Permanent Static IP on CentOS/RHEL (with Network-Scripts)**

In CentOS and RHEL, network configuration is done using **network-scripts**.

### **Steps to Set Permanent Static IP:**

1. **Edit the Interface Configuration File:**
   The configuration file for network interfaces is located in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/`. Edit the file for your interface (e.g., `ifcfg-eth0`):
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
   ```

2. **Configure Static IP:**
   Modify the file as follows:
   ```ini
   BOOTPROTO=none        # Disable DHCP
   ONBOOT=yes            # Enable interface at boot
   IPADDR=192.168.1.10   # Set static IP
   PREFIX=24             # Set subnet mask (255.255.255.0)
   GATEWAY=192.168.1.1   # Set Gateway
   DNS1=8.8.8.8          # Set DNS
   DNS2=8.8.4.4
   ```

3. **Restart Network Service:**
   After saving the file, restart the network service to apply changes:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart network
   ```

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Permanent Static IP on Older Systems (using `ifconfig`)**

For older systems, network configuration is done through `/etc/network/interfaces` or similar files.

### **Steps to Set Permanent Static IP:**

1. **Edit the Interface Configuration File:**
   In some older systems, you may configure network settings in `/etc/network/interfaces`:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
   ```

2. **Configure Static IP:**
   Modify the file to look like this:
   ```ini
   iface eth0 inet static
   address 192.168.1.10
   netmask 255.255.255.0
   gateway 192.168.1.1
   dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   ```

3. **Restart Network Service:**
   After saving the file, restart the networking service:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart networking
   ```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Enabling IP Forwarding Permanently**

To enable IP forwarding permanently, you need to modify the `/etc/sysctl.conf` file.

### **Steps to Enable IP Forwarding:**

1. **Edit the `sysctl.conf` file:**
   Open the file `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
   ```

2. **Enable IP Forwarding:**
   Add or modify the following line:
   ```ini
   net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
   ```

3. **Apply Changes:**
   Apply the changes by running:
   ```sh
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Configuring DNS Permanently**

To configure DNS servers permanently:

### **Steps for Ubuntu/Debian:**

1. **Edit the `resolved.conf` file:**
   Open `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`:
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
   ```

2. **Set DNS Servers:**
   Add the following DNS settings:
   ```ini
   DNS=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
   FallbackDNS=1.1.1.1
   ```

3. **Restart the systemd-resolved service:**
   Apply changes by restarting the service:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
   ```

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Verifying Permanent Static IP**

After setting the static IP, use the following commands to verify that your settings are applied correctly:

### **Check IP Address:**
```sh
ip addr show
```
or, for older systems:
```sh
ifconfig
```

---

## **Conclusion:**
- **Ubuntu/Debian (Netplan):** Edit the file `/etc/netplan/*.yaml`.
- **CentOS/RHEL:** Edit the file `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`.
- **Older Systems:** Edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces`.
- **Permanent IP Forwarding:** Modify `/etc/sysctl.conf` and run `sysctl -p`.
- **Permanent DNS Configuration:** Use `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` or `/etc/resolv.conf`.

üöÄ **These methods will ensure that your static IP configuration persists after reboot!**
