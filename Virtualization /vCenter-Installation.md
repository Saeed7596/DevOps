- Static IP address reserved for vCenter
- Minimum system resources:
  - 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM (lab minimum)
  - 250 GB disk space

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Download vCenter Server ISO

1. Go to [VMware Customer Connect](https://customerconnect.vmware.com).
2. Download the **vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) ISO** for version 8.x.

---

## 💻 Step 2: Mount the ISO and Run Installer

1. Mount the ISO on your local machine.
2. Open the mounted ISO and run:
   - On Windows: `vcsa-ui-installer\\win32\\installer.exe`
   - On macOS: `vcsa-ui-installer/mac/installer`

---

## 🛠 Step 3: Install vCenter Server (Stage 1)

1. Click on **Install**.
2. Accept the license agreement.
3. Enter the **ESXi host IP** or FQDN where the VCSA will be deployed.
4. Provide ESXi credentials.
5. Accept SSL thumbprint.
6. Set the name and root password for the VCSA VM.
7. Choose the deployment size:
   - Tiny (for labs)
   - Small, Medium, Large (for production)
8. Choose the datastore for the VCSA.
9. Configure network settings:
   - Static IP
   - FQDN
   - Subnet mask
   - Gateway
   - DNS
10. Review and finish Stage 1 deployment.

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Configure vCenter (Stage 2)

1. After Stage 1 is complete, click **Continue** to begin Stage 2.
2. Set up:
   - NTP or time sync with host
   - Enable SSH (optional)
3. Configure SSO:
   - Domain name (default: `vsphere.local`)
   - SSO password
4. Join CEIP (optional)
5. Complete setup and wait for services to start.

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Access vCenter

- Open your browser and go to: `https://<vcenter-ip-or-fqdn>`

- Login with:
- Username: `administrator@vsphere.local`
- Password: (your SSO password)

---

## ✅ Post-Installation Checklist

- Configure vCenter licensing
- Add ESXi hosts to inventory
- Set up datacenters and clusters
- Configure backup (VAMI or external)
- Enable alarms and email notifications

---

## 📝 Notes

- Ensure DNS resolution works for FQDN and reverse lookup.
- Keep time synced across ESXi and vCenter (use NTP).
- Back up vCenter regularly using file-based backup.

# 📦 Differences Between Snapshot, Clone, and Template in vSphere

## Snapshot
- Captures the exact state of a VM (disk, memory, and settings) at a specific point in time.
- Used mainly for short-term backup purposes (e.g., before updates).
- **Depends on the original VM** and is **not a full copy**.
- Allows rollback to the captured state if needed.

## Clone
- Creates a **full, independent copy** of an existing VM.
- Once created, the clone is completely separate and can be powered on and modified.
- Useful for creating development, test, or production VMs.

## Template
- A **specialized, read-only copy** of a VM designed for standardized deployments.
- Cannot be powered on directly.
- VMs are deployed from templates to ensure consistent and repeatable configurations.
- To edit, you must first convert the template back into a VM.

## 🔥 Quick Comparison Table

| Type      | Dependency             | Use Case                        | Editable After Creation |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Snapshot  | Depends on original VM   | Quick rollback before changes   | Yes (by reverting)       |
| Clone     | Independent copy         | Duplicate for independent use   | Yes                      |
| Template  | Independent, read-only   | Standardized VM deployment      | No (needs conversion)    |

---

## 🛠 Example Use Cases
- **Snapshot:** Before OS patching or application upgrade.
- **Clone:** Quickly create a development or testing environment.
- **Template:** Rapidly deploy standardized VMs across the organization.
