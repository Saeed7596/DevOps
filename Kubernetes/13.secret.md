# Secret
#### Stores sensitive data such as passwords and API keys.
# What is a Secret in Kubernetes?
A **Secret** in Kubernetes is an object used to store and manage sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, TLS certificates, and other confidential data. In simple terms, Secret helps you securely store and manage sensitive information in a Kubernetes cluster.

---

## Why Should We Use Secrets?
1. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Sensitive information like passwords or API keys should not be stored directly in configuration files or application code. Secrets store this information securely.
2. **Separation of Sensitive Information from Code**:
   - Using Secrets allows you to separate sensitive information from the application code, making the code cleaner and more secure.
3. **Centralized Management of Sensitive Information**:
   - Secrets enable you to manage sensitive information centrally and easily inject it into applications.
4. **Support for Base64 Encoding**:
   - Information in Secrets is encoded in Base64 by default. While this is not highly secure, it is better than storing information in plain text.

---

## What Can Secrets Contain?
Secrets can include various types of sensitive information, such as:

- **Passwords**: For databases or external services.
- **API Keys**: For accessing external services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Stripe.
- **TLS Certificates**: For secure communications.
- **Authentication Tokens**: For accessing internal or external services.

---

## Where is it Useful?
- **Connecting to Databases**:
  - Securely store database usernames and passwords and inject them into the application.
- **Connecting to External Services**:
  - Store API keys for accessing services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Stripe.
- **Secure Communications**:
  - Store TLS certificates for establishing secure HTTPS connections between services.
- **Managing Sensitive Information in Different Environments**:
  - You can have separate Secrets for Development, Staging, and Production environments.

---

## How Do Secrets Work?
Secrets store sensitive information, and you can inject this information into your application in one of the following ways:

1. **As Environment Variables**:
   - Information from Secrets is injected as environment variables into the application.
2. **As Files Inside the Container**:
   - Information from Secrets is placed as files in a specified path inside the container.

---

## Types of Secrets
### 1. Opaque (General-Purpose)
**What is it?**
This type of Secret is like a general-purpose box where you can store anything, from passwords to API keys or any other key:value data.
**When is it useful?**
When you have specific information that doesnâ€™t fit into other categories, such as database passwords or API keys.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=   # Base64-encoded "admin"
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=   # Base64-encoded "password"
```

---

### 2. kubernetes.io/tls (For TLS Certificates)
#### What is it?
This type of Secret is designed to store TLS certificates (SSL Certificates) and private keys, used for secure HTTPS communications.
#### When is it useful?
When you want to secure a service or website with HTTPS.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: tls-secret
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  tls.crt: <Base64-encoded certificate>
  tls.key: <Base64-encoded private key>
```

---

### 3. kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson (For Docker Registry)
#### What is it?
This type of Secret is used to store login credentials (username and password) for Docker registries, where container images are stored.
#### When is it useful?
When you need to pull container images from a private registry.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: docker-registry-secret
type: kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
data:
  .dockerconfigjson: <Base64-encoded Docker config JSON>
```

---
### 4. kubernetes.io/basic-auth (For Basic Authentication)
#### What is it?
This type of Secret is used to store basic authentication information, such as usernames and passwords.
#### When is it useful?
When you have a service that uses simple username and password authentication.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: basic-auth-secret
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=   # Base64-encoded "admin"
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=   # Base64-encoded "password"
```

---
### 5. kubernetes.io/ssh-auth (For SSH Authentication)
#### What is it?
This type of Secret is used to store SSH private keys, which are used for secure connections to servers or other services.
#### When is it useful?
When an application or service needs to connect to another server via SSH.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: ssh-auth-secret
type: kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
data:
  ssh-privatekey: <Base64-encoded SSH private key>
```

---

### 6. kubernetes.io/service-account-token (Service Account Token)
#### What is it?
This type of Secret is automatically created by Kubernetes and contains tokens for accessing the cluster API.
#### When is it useful?
When a Pod needs to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster API.
**Example**:
This type of Secret is usually created automatically and does not need to be manually defined.

---

### 7. Custom Types (Custom Secrets)
#### What is it?
If none of the above types fit your needs, you can define a custom Secret type. This is used for specific cases.
#### When is it useful?
When you have a specific application or service that requires a unique format for Secrets.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: custom-secret
type: my-custom-type
data:
  custom-key: <Base64-encoded value>
```

---

# Example: Using Secret as a Hidden File (Dotfiles)
This example demonstrates how to use a Secret in Kubernetes to securely place sensitive information as a hidden file (dotfile) inside a container. Let's break it down step by step.

---

## What Do We Have Here?
- **A Secret named `dotfile-secret`**:
  - This Secret contains a hidden file named `.secret-file` with a Base64-encoded value (`dmFsdWUtMg0KDQo=`). When decoded, this value becomes `value-2`.
- **A Pod named `secret-dotfiles-pod`**:
  - This Pod has a container that mounts the Secret as a file in the path `/etc/secret-volume`. The container then lists the contents of this path using the `ls -l` command.

---

## Step-by-Step Manifest Breakdown
### 1. Defining the Secret
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: dotfile-secret
data:
  .secret-file: dmFsdWUtMg0KDQo=
```
### What does it do?
- A Secret named `dotfile-secret` is defined.
- This Secret contains a hidden file named `.secret-file` with a Base64-encoded value (`dmFsdWUtMg0KDQo=`). When decoded, this value becomes `value-2`.
Note:
- Files starting with a dot (`.`) are known as hidden files (dotfiles).

### 2. Defining the Pod
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: secret-dotfiles-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: dotfile-secret
  containers:
    - name: dotfile-test-container
      image: registry.k8s.io/busybox
      command:
        - ls
        - "-l"
        - "/etc/secret-volume"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: secret-volume
          readOnly: true
          mountPath: "/etc/secret-volume"
```
### What does it do?
- A Pod named `secret-dotfiles-pod` is defined, which includes:
1. Volume:
    - A Volume named `secret-volume` is defined, which uses the `dotfile-secret` Secret. This Volume injects the Secret's data into the container.

2. Container:
    - The container uses the `busybox` image (a lightweight image for testing). It runs the following command:
    ```bash
    ls -l /etc/secret-volume
    ```
    This command lists the contents of the `/etc/secret-volume` path.

3. Volume Mount:
    - The `secret-volume` Volume is mounted to the `/etc/secret-volume` path inside the container. This means the Secret files are placed in this path.

4. Read-Only Mode:
    - The Volume is mounted as read-only (`readOnly: true`), meaning the container cannot modify the Secret files.

### What Happens When This Pod Runs?
When this Pod runs, the container executes the command `ls -l /etc/secret-volume` and lists the contents of the `/etc/secret-volume` path. The output will look something like this:
```
-r--r--r--    1 root     root            8 Jan 25 12:00 .secret-file
```
### What does it mean?
- There is a hidden file named `.secret-file` in the `/etc/secret-volume` path.
- This file is read-only.
- The file size is 8 bytes (because it contains the value `value-2`).

### How to View the File Content?
If you want to view the content of the `.secret-file` inside the container, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl exec -it secret-dotfiles-pod -- cat /etc/secret-volume/.secret-file
```
Output:
```
value-2
```

### What Does This Example Show?
1. Managing Hidden Files:
    - This example shows how to securely place hidden files (dotfiles) inside a container.

2. Enhanced Security:
    - Sensitive information (like configuration files or private keys) is securely and read-only injected into the container.

3. Simplicity and Flexibility:
    - Kubernetes makes it easy to use Secrets as files inside containers.

### Summary
- What did we do?
    - We defined a Secret containing a hidden file and injected it as a Volume into a container. Then, we listed the contents of the file.
- Why is this important?
    - This method is very useful for managing sensitive files (like private keys or configuration files) and ensures the security of the information.

# ServiceAccount Token Secrets and Docker Config Secrets
Here, we have two main topics: **ServiceAccount Token Secrets** and **Docker Config Secrets**. Let's explore each with examples and explanations.

## 1. ServiceAccount Token Secrets
### What is a ServiceAccount?
- A ServiceAccount is a non-human account in Kubernetes used by applications or services running inside the cluster.
- This account allows Pods to communicate with the cluster API.

### What is a ServiceAccount Token Secret?
- This type of Secret contains a JWT (JSON Web Token) used for authentication and accessing the cluster API.
- Before Kubernetes 1.22: These tokens were long-lived and automatically created for each ServiceAccount.
- After Kubernetes 1.22: Short-lived and more secure tokens, called Bound ServiceAccount Tokens, replaced them. These tokens are automatically managed and do not require manual creation.

### Why Use ServiceAccount Token Secrets?
- When a Pod needs to communicate with the cluster API.
- If you cannot use short-lived tokens (e.g., for specific reasons), you can create a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/service-account-token`.

**Example: Creating a ServiceAccount Token Secret**
1. Create a ServiceAccount:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
    name: sa-name
```
2. Create a Secret for the ServiceAccount:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-sa-sample
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/service-account.name: "sa-name"
type: kubernetes.io/service-account-token
data:
  extra: YmFyCg==   # Base64-encoded "bar"
```
### What does it do?
- This Secret is linked to the `sa-name` ServiceAccount. Kubernetes automatically populates the `token` field in this Secret.

3. Use the ServiceAccount in a Pod:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: sa-name
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token"]
```
### What does it do?
- This Pod uses the `sa-name` ServiceAccount. The JWT token stored in the Secret is automatically placed in the path `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`. The `cat` command prints the content of this file.

When this Pod runs, you can view the JWT token content by running:
```bash
kubectl logs my-pod
```
Output:
```
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ik5... (JWT token)
```

## 2. Docker Config Secrets
### What is a Docker Config Secret?
- This type of Secret is used to store login credentials (username and password) for Docker registries, where container images are stored.
- There are two main types:
- `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`: The old format for Docker config files.
- `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`: The new format for Docker config files.

### Why Use Docker Config Secrets?
- When you need to pull container images from a private registry.
- This Secret securely stores login credentials (e.g., username and password).

**Example: Creating a Docker Config Secret**
1. Create a Secret of Type `kubernetes.io/dockercfg`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-dockercfg
type: kubernetes.io/dockercfg
data:
  .dockercfg: |
    eyJhdXRocyI6eyJodHRwczovL2V4YW1wbGUvdjEvIjp7ImF1dGgiOiJvcGVuc2VzYW1lIn19fQo=
```
#### What does it do?
- This Secret stores Docker registry login credentials. The `.dockercfg` value is Base64-encoded.

2. Create a Secret Using kubectl:
Instead of writing a YAML file, you can use the following command:
```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry secret-tiger-docker \
     --docker-email=tiger@acme.example \
     --docker-username=tiger \
     --docker-password=pass1234 \
     --docker-server=my-registry.example:5000
```
#### What does it do?
- This command creates a Secret of type `kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson`.
To view the content of the Secret, run:
```bash
kubectl get secret secret-tiger-docker -o jsonpath='{.data.*}' | base64 -d
```
Output:
```json
{
  "auths": {
    "my-registry.example:5000": {
      "username": "tiger",
      "password": "pass1234",
      "email": "tiger@acme.example",
      "auth": "dGlnZXI6cGFzczEyMzQ="
    }
  }
}
```

---

# Important Notes
- ServiceAccount Tokens:
    - Long-lived tokens are less secure. It's better to use short-lived tokens.
    - If you use long-lived tokens, make sure to restrict their permissions.

- Docker Config Secrets:
- The `auth` value in the Docker config file is Base64-encoded. This encoding is not fully secure, so you should manage the Secret securely.
- It is recommended to use Credential Providers to dynamically and securely provide login credentials.

## Summary
- **ServiceAccount Token Secrets**: Used for authenticating Pods to the cluster API. Short-lived tokens are more secure and recommended.
- **Docker Config Secrets**: Used to store login credentials for Docker registries. You can use the old format (`dockercfg`) or the new format (`dockerconfigjson`).

Note: 
1. Secrets are not Encrypted. Only encoded.
2. Secrets are not Encrypted in ETCD.
3. Anyone able to create pods/deployments in the same namespace can access the secrets..
