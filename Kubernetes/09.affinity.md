# Difference Between `label` and `taint` in Kubernetes

| Feature   | **Label** | **Taint** |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Used for **grouping and filtering** resources like `Pods`, `Nodes`, `PVCs`, `Services`, etc. | Used to **restrict scheduling** of pods on specific nodes. |
| **Applies To** | Can be applied to **Pods, Nodes, PVCs, Services, etc.** | Only applies to **Nodes**. |
| **Main Use Case** | - Organizing resources <br> - Filtering with **Selectors** <br> - Used in **Node Affinity** | - Preventing **undesired pods** from running on specific nodes <br> - Enforcing **special scheduling conditions** |
| **How Pods are Scheduled on Nodes?** | Pods are scheduled on nodes with specific labels using `nodeSelector` or `nodeAffinity`. | Only pods with matching `tolerations` can be scheduled on tainted nodes. |
| **Command to Apply** | ```sh kubectl label node node01 env=production ``` | ```sh kubectl taint node node01 key=value:Effect ``` |

**Label** is used to **identify and categorize nodes and pods**.  
**Taint** is used to **restrict pod scheduling on nodes**.
