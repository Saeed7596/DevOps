# Node Affinity
#### Specifies rules to influence where Pods are scheduled.
# Summary:

## Node Affinity
Node Affinity allows you to specify which nodes Pods should or should not run on. This feature is used for resource management, performance optimization, and compliance with specific rules.

### Two Main Types:
1. **RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**: Strict rule.
   - If no node with the specified label is found, the Pod will not be scheduled.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: gpu-pod
   spec:
     affinity:
       nodeAffinity:
         requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
           nodeSelectorTerms:
           - matchExpressions:
             - key: gpu
               operator: In
               values:
               - "true"
     containers:
     - name: gpu-container
       image: nginx
    ```

2. **PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**: Preferred rule.
    - Kubernetes tries to schedule the Pod on nodes that meet the conditions, but if none are found, it will run on other nodes.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: zone-pod
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 1
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: zone
                operator: In
                values:
                - "us-east-1"
      containers:
      - name: zone-container
        image: nginx    
    ```
Using Node Affinity, you can more precisely manage Pod placement.

## Node Anti-Affinity
Node Anti-Affinity allows you to specify which nodes Pods should not run on. This feature is used to increase availability, manage resources, and prevent excessive traffic on a single node.

### Two Main Types:
1. **RequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**: Strict rule.
    - If all nodes meet the specified conditions, the Pod will not be scheduled.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: anti-affinity-pod
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: zone
                operator: NotIn
                values:
                - "us-east-1"
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
    ```
2. **PreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution**: Preferred rule.
    - Kubernetes tries to schedule the Pod on nodes that do not meet the specified conditions, but if none are found, it will run on other nodes.
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: preferred-anti-affinity-pod
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 1
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: zone
                operator: NotIn
                values:
                - "us-west-1"
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
    ```
Using Node Anti-Affinity, you can more precisely manage Pod placement.

### Summary:
- `Node Affinity`: Allows you to control which nodes Pods should run on.
- `Node Anti-Affinity`: Allows you to control which nodes Pods should **    ** run on.
- Both features help you manage Pod placement more precisely, ensuring better resource utilization and availability.

# Difference Between `label` and `taint` in Kubernetes

| Feature   | **Label** | **Taint** |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Purpose** | Used for **grouping and filtering** resources like `Pods`, `Nodes`, `PVCs`, `Services`, etc. | Used to **restrict scheduling** of pods on specific nodes. |
| **Applies To** | Can be applied to **Pods, Nodes, PVCs, Services, etc.** | Only applies to **Nodes**. |
| **Main Use Case** | - Organizing resources <br> - Filtering with **Selectors** <br> - Used in **Node Affinity** | - Preventing **undesired pods** from running on specific nodes <br> - Enforcing **special scheduling conditions** |
| **How Pods are Scheduled on Nodes?** | Pods are scheduled on nodes with specific labels using `nodeSelector` or `nodeAffinity`. | Only pods with matching `tolerations` can be scheduled on tainted nodes. |
| **Command to Apply** | ```sh kubectl label node node01 env=production ``` | ```sh kubectl taint node node01 key=value:Effect ``` |

**Label** is used to **identify and categorize nodes and pods**.  
**Taint** is used to **restrict pod scheduling on nodes**.
