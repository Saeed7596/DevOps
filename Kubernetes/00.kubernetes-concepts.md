# ðŸ“Œ Table 1: Kubernetes Workloads and Key Concepts

| **Term**                   | **Description** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster**               | A group of nodes where Kubernetes runs. |
| **Node**                  | A machine (physical or virtual) that is part of the cluster and runs Pods. |
| **Pod**                   | The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes containing one or more containers. |
| **Deployment**            | Manages automated rollout, scaling, and updates of Pods. |
| **ReplicaSet**            | Ensures a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times. |
| **StatefulSet**           | Manages stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage. |
| **DaemonSet**             | Ensures that a copy of a Pod runs on all (or some) nodes, useful for logging and monitoring. |
| **Job**                   | Runs a batch task once and ensures completion. |
| **CronJob**               | Runs Jobs at scheduled times, similar to Linux cron jobs. |
| **Namespace**            | Provides a way to logically isolate Kubernetes resources within a cluster. |
| **Ingress**              | Manages external access to services within a cluster. |
| **Ingress Networking**   | Controls how traffic is routed into and out of the cluster. |
| **Service**              | Provides stable networking and communication between Pods. |
| **Persistent Volume (PV)** | A cluster-wide storage resource provisioned by an administrator. |
| **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)** | A request for storage by a Pod that binds to a PV. |
| **Storage Class**        | Defines different types of storage and allows dynamic provisioning. |
| **ConfigMap**           | Stores key-value configuration data for Pods. |
| **Secret**              | Stores sensitive data such as passwords and API keys. |
| **Service Accounts**     | Provides identity and permissions to Pods and services within a cluster. |
| **Taint & Toleration**   | Restricts Pods from scheduling on certain nodes unless explicitly tolerated. |
| **Affinity & Anti-Affinity** | Specifies rules to influence where Pods are scheduled. |
| **Labels and Selectors** | Used to categorize and filter Kubernetes resources. |
| **Annotations**         | Adds metadata or descriptive information to Kubernetes objects. |
| **initContainer**       | A special container that runs before the main container in a Pod. |
| **Static Pods**         | Pods that run directly on a node without being managed by the API server. |
| **Logging & Monitoring** | Observing cluster performance and collecting logs for debugging. |
| **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)** | Automatically scales Pods horizontally based on resource usage. |
| **VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler)** | Adjusts CPU and memory resources for Pods dynamically. |
| **CNI (Container Network Interface)** | A standard for configuring network interfaces in Kubernetes. |
| **kubectl**             | The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes. |
| **kube-proxy**          | Manages network communication between Pods and services across different nodes in the cluster. |
| **Role**        | Defines a set of permissions (rules) within a specific namespace, allowing access to Kubernetes resources. |
| **RoleBinding** | Associates a `Role` with users, groups, or service accounts, granting them the defined permissions. |
| **ClusterRole** | Similar to `Role`, but applies cluster-wide instead of being restricted to a namespace. |
| **ClusterRoleBinding** | Assigns a `ClusterRole` to users, groups, or service accounts at the cluster level. |

# ðŸ“Œ Table 2: Control Plane Components vs Node Components

## **Control Plane Components**

| **Component**              | **Description** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **kube-apiserver**        | The main API entry point that processes Kubernetes requests. |
| **etcd**                  | A distributed key-value store that holds cluster configuration data. |
| **kube-scheduler**        | Assigns Pods to nodes based on resource availability. |
| **kube-controller-manager** | Manages controllers such as ReplicaSet, ensuring the desired state is maintained. |
| **cloud-controller-manager** | Integrates Kubernetes with cloud providers for resource management. |

## **Node Components**

| **Component**        | **Description** |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **kubelet**        | Runs on each node and ensures that Pods are running correctly. |
| **kube-proxy**     | Manages network communication between services. |
| **Container Runtime** | Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd). |

# ðŸ“Œ Table 3: Gateway API vs HTTPRoute

| **Term**        | **Description** |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gateway API** | A modern API for managing network traffic in Kubernetes, providing more flexibility than Ingress. |
| **HTTPRoute**   | A resource within Gateway API that defines routing rules for HTTP traffic. |
