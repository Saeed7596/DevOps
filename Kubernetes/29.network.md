# Network
# **Network Policies**
## Ingress → Traffic entering a Pod or network.
- Definition: Ingress refers to requests that enter a Pod or network from outside.
- In Kubernetes We have two types of Ingress controls:
  - `NetworkPolicy`: Restricts access between Pods and the network.
  - `Ingress Controller`: Controls access to services from outside the cluster (such as `nginx-ingress`)
## Egress → Traffic leaving a Pod or network.
- Definition: Egress refers to requests that leave a Pod or network.
  - In Kubernetes By default, Pods can connect to anywhere on the internet or internal network.
  - Egress Policy can restrict this access.

```bash
kubectl get netpol
kubectl get networkpolicy
kubectl describe networkpolicy
kubectl get svc -n kube-system
```
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy

  name: internal-policy
  namespace: default

## CNI (Container Network Interface),

| The CNI binaries are located under `/opt/cni/bin` by default.|
| `ls /etc/cni/net.d/` | Identify the name of the plugin. |
| `cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist` | Look at the `type` field |

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ip route
```
---
What is the range of IP addresses configured for PODs on this cluster?
`kubectl logs <weave-pod-name> -n kube-system` and look for `ipalloc-range`.

What is the IP Range configured for the services within the cluster?
Inspect the setting on kube-api server by running on command
`cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep cluster-ip-range`

What type of proxy is the kube-proxy configured to use?
`kubectl logs <kube-proxy-pod-name> -n kube-system`
