# Network
## Ingress → Traffic entering a Pod or network.
- Definition: Ingress refers to requests that enter a Pod or network from outside.
- In Kubernetes We have two types of Ingress controls:
  - `NetworkPolicy`: Restricts access between Pods and the network.
  - `Ingress Controller`: Controls access to services from outside the cluster (such as `nginx-ingress`)
## Egress → Traffic leaving a Pod or network.
- Definition: Egress refers to requests that leave a Pod or network.
  - In Kubernetes By default, Pods can connect to anywhere on the internet or internal network.
  - Egress Policy can restrict this access.

# **Network Policies**
```bash
kubectl get netpol
kubectl get networkpolicy
kubectl describe networkpolicy
kubectl get svc -n kube-system
```
## When Should You Use Network Policy?
1. **To Enhance Security**:
   - If you don’t want all Pods to freely communicate with each other, you should use Network Policy.
2. **To Restrict Access**:
   - For example, only specific Pods should be allowed to connect to a database.
3. **To Control Outbound Traffic**:
   - For instance, a Pod should only be able to connect to a specific API on the internet.
4. **To Prevent Attacks**:
   - If a Pod gets compromised, you can use Network Policy to restrict its access and prevent the attack from spreading.
Note: Netowrk Plolicy Cubernetis does not work in defects and has a knife to the Networking model you choose when installing.

## A Complete NetworkPolicy Manifest Example

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
            except:
              - 172.17.1.0/24
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              project: myproject
          podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6379
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5978
```
This NetworkPolicy defines a set of rules to control incoming (Ingress) and outgoing (Egress) network traffic for Pods with the label `role: db`. Let’s break it down line by line to understand what this Policy does.
1. `podSelector` Section:
- Here, we specify that this Policy applies only to Pods with the label `role: db`.
- Any Pod without this label will not be affected by this Policy.

2. `policyTypes` Section:
- We specify that this Policy controls both incoming (Ingress) and outgoing (Egress) traffic.
- This means we define what traffic can enter the Pod and what traffic can leave the Pod.

3. `ingress` Section (Incoming Traffic Control):
- `from:`:
    - We specify which traffic is allowed to enter the Pod:
        - `ipBlock:`:
            - Only traffic from IPs within the range 172.17.0.0/16 is allowed.
            - However, IPs in the range 172.17.1.0/24 are excluded and not allowed.
        - `namespaceSelector + podSelector:`:
            - Only Pods in Namespaces with the label project: myproject and with the label role: frontend are allowed to access this Pod.
- `ports:`:
    - Only traffic on TCP protocol and port 6379 (commonly used for Redis) is allowed.

4. `egress` Section (Outgoing Traffic Control):
- `to:`:
    - We specify which traffic is allowed to leave the Pod:
        - Only traffic destined for IPs within the range 10.0.0.0/24 is allowed.
- `ports:`:
    - Only traffic on TCP protocol and port 5978 is allowed.

### What Happens When You Apply This Policy?
Incoming Traffic (Ingress):
- Only traffic from IPs within the range `172.17.0.0/16` (except `172.17.1.0/24`) is allowed.
- Or, traffic from Pods with the label `role: frontend` in Namespaces with the label `project: myproject` is allowed.
- Only traffic on port `6379` is allowed.

Outgoing Traffic (Egress):
- Only traffic destined for IPs within the range `10.0.0.0/24` is allowed.
- Only traffic on port `5978` is allowed.

## CNI (Container Network Interface),

| The CNI binaries are located under `/opt/cni/bin` by default.|
| `ls /etc/cni/net.d/` | Identify the name of the plugin. |
| `cat /etc/cni/net.d/10-flannel.conflist` | Look at the `type` field |

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- ip route
```
---
What is the range of IP addresses configured for PODs on this cluster?
`kubectl logs <weave-pod-name> -n kube-system` and look for `ipalloc-range`.

What is the IP Range configured for the services within the cluster?
Inspect the setting on kube-api server by running on command
`cat /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml | grep cluster-ip-range`

What type of proxy is the kube-proxy configured to use?
`kubectl logs <kube-proxy-pod-name> -n kube-system`
