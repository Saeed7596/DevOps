# StatefulSets
## Why Use StatefulSets?

**StatefulSets** in Kubernetes are used for applications that require persistent state and stable, unique network identifiers. They are designed for workloads that need to maintain state across pod restarts, like databases or services that need specific network identities.

### What is a StatefulSet?

A **StatefulSet** is a controller in Kubernetes used to manage stateful applications. Unlike **Deployments** (used for stateless apps), StatefulSets ensure that pods maintain their identity, persistent storage, and stable network names.
### **Important Note**:
* Data is not automatically merged between different replicas in a StatefulSet. Each replica in a StatefulSet has its own separate and independent Persistent Volume Claim (PVC), and its data is completely isolated unless you implement a sync or replication mechanism within your application.
### Key Features:
- **Stable, Unique Network Identifiers**: Pods are assigned fixed names (`pod-0`, `pod-1`, ...) that remain consistent across restarts.
- **Persistent Storage**: Each pod gets its own persistent volume (PV) that retains data across pod restarts.
- **Ordered Deployment and Scaling**: Pods are created and terminated in a specific order (e.g., `pod-0` first, then `pod-1`).
- **DNS Names**: Each pod gets a unique DNS name that allows it to be easily discovered in the network.

### Use Cases:
- **Databases**: StatefulSets are ideal for distributed databases like **Cassandra** or **MongoDB** where each pod holds state.
- **Applications** that need stable network identities and persistent storage.

### Example:
For a database like MongoDB, each pod in the StatefulSet might hold part of the database's data and have a stable hostname, such as `mongodb-0`, `mongodb-1`, etc. These names ensure that nodes can communicate reliably and retain their data.

Here’s an example of a StatefulSet YAML file for a MongoDB deployment:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mongo
spec:
  serviceName: "mongo"  # Use the headless service for stable networking
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongo
        image: mongo:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mongo-data
          mountPath: /data/db
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: mongo-data
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```
Explanation:
- `replicas`: 3: Creates 3 MongoDB pods.
- `volumeClaimTemplates`: Defines persistent storage for each pod. Each pod will get its own persistent volume (PVC).
- `statefulSet Name`: The StatefulSet is named `mongo`, and each pod will get a name like `mongo-0`, `mongo-1`, `mongo-2`.
- `Service`: The `serviceName: "mongo"` allows the StatefulSet to use a headless service to manage networking and DNS for stable pod communication.
Each MongoDB pod gets its own unique volume and network identity, which is ideal for stateful applications like databases.

## Headless Service in Kubernetes

A **Headless Service** in Kubernetes is a service without a cluster IP. Instead of routing traffic to a single IP, it allows direct access to individual pods via DNS. This is particularly useful for stateful applications like **StatefulSets**.

### Key Features:
- **No ClusterIP**: Set `clusterIP: None` to create a headless service with no shared IP.
- **DNS for Individual Pods**: Each pod gets a unique DNS record (e.g., `pod-0.service-name`, `pod-1.service-name`).
- **Direct Pod Access**: Allows applications to connect directly to individual pods, useful for distributed databases or services.

### Use Cases:
- **StatefulSets**: Ensures stable networking for applications like **MongoDB** or **Cassandra**.
- **Direct Pod Communication**: Enables direct communication between pods for applications that require specific network identities.

### Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo
  labels:
    app: mongo
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # Headless service
  selector:
    app: mongo
  ports:
    - port: 27017
      targetPort: 27017
```
A headless service provides unique DNS names for each pod, ensuring stable and direct communication, ideal for stateful applications.

# Pod Management Policy in StatefulSet

## 1. OrderedReady (Default)
This is the default mode for StatefulSet. When this setting is active, Kubernetes manages Pods in a specific order. Specifically:

- **Creating Pods**: First, `pod-0` is created, and until this Pod reaches the `Ready` state, `pod-1` is not created. After `pod-1` is ready, `pod-2` is created, and so on.
- **Deleting Pods**: Opposite to creation, when you delete a StatefulSet or reduce the number of replicas, Kubernetes starts from the last Pod. For example, `pod-2` is deleted first, then `pod-1`, and finally `pod-0`.
- **Updating Pods**: During updates (e.g., changing the container image), Kubernetes also follows the order. For example, `pod-0` is updated first, then `pod-1`, and so on.

### When to Use OrderedReady?
This mode is ideal for applications that require a specific order for startup or shutdown. Examples include:
- Databases with replica sets (e.g., MongoDB or Cassandra).
- Applications where Pods need to communicate with each other in a specific order.

### What’s the Problem with OrderedReady?
- **Slowness**: Since Pods are created or updated one by one, it may take a long time for all Pods to become ready. For example, if you have 10 Pods, you must wait for each one to become ready sequentially.

---

## 2. Parallel
In this mode, Kubernetes manages Pods in parallel. Specifically:

- **Creating Pods**: All Pods are created simultaneously. For example, `pod-0`, `pod-1`, and `pod-2` start being created at the same time.
- **Deleting Pods**: All Pods can be deleted in parallel.
- **Updating Pods**: Pod updates can also be done in parallel (though this depends on other settings like `partition`).

### When to Use Parallel?
This mode is great for applications that do not require a specific order and need Pods to be created quickly. Examples include:
- Stateless applications that just need to start up quickly.
- When you have a large number of Pods and don’t want to wait for them to be created one by one.

### What’s the Problem with Parallel?
- **Lack of Order**: Since Pods are created simultaneously, applications that require a specific order may face issues.

---

## Comparison: OrderedReady vs. Parallel

### OrderedReady:
1. Kubernetes creates `pod-0` first.
2. When `pod-0` reaches the `Ready` state, `pod-1` is created.
3. When `pod-1` is ready, `pod-2` is created.

### Parallel:
1. Kubernetes creates all Pods (`pod-0`, `pod-1`, `pod-2`) simultaneously.
2. Each Pod becomes `Ready` as soon as it is prepared.

---

## Important Note About Changing Pod Management Policy
You **cannot** change this setting for an existing StatefulSet. If you created a StatefulSet with a specific `podManagementPolicy`, you cannot modify it later. To change it, you must delete the StatefulSet and recreate it with the new settings.

---

## Summary
- **OrderedReady**: Ideal for applications that require a specific order (e.g., databases), but slower.
- **Parallel**: Better for applications where order is not important, and speed is a priority.
The choice between these two depends on your application’s needs and your priorities.

# Update Strategy in StatefulSet

The **Update Strategy** in StatefulSet tells Kubernetes how to manage Pods during updates. This feature allows you to specify how and in what order Pods should be updated. There are two main types of update strategies: **RollingUpdate** and **OnDelete**.

---

## 1. RollingUpdate
This strategy allows Kubernetes to update Pods gradually and in a specific order. In this mode, Kubernetes updates Pods incrementally, changing only one Pod at a time. This ensures that your application remains available during the update.

### Features of RollingUpdate:
- **Incremental**: Only one Pod is updated at a time.
- **Availability**: A certain number of Pods are always running during the update, so your application remains available.
- **Configuration**: You can use parameters like `partition` to determine which Pods should be updated.

### Example of RollingUpdate:
Assume you have a StatefulSet with 3 Pods, and you want to update the `nginx` image to a newer version. With RollingUpdate, Kubernetes works as follows:
1. **Update pod-0**: Kubernetes first updates `web2-0`.
2. **Check status**: After `web2-0` reaches the `Ready` state, it moves to `web2-1`.
3. **Update pod-1**: Now, `web2-1` is updated.
4. **Check status**: When `web2-1` is ready, it moves to `web2-2`.
5. **Update pod-2**: Finally, `web2-2` is updated.
This process is gradual, and at least one Pod remains running at all times.

---

## 2. OnDelete
In this strategy, Pods are only updated when you manually delete them. This means you have more control over when and how the update happens, but your application may become unavailable during the update.

### Features of OnDelete:
- **Manual Control**: You must manually delete Pods for Kubernetes to create new ones with the updated version.
- **Potential Downtime**: During the update, the number of running Pods may decrease, and your application may become unavailable.

### Example of OnDelete:
Assume you have a StatefulSet with 3 Pods, and you want to update the `nginx` image. With OnDelete, you must manually delete the Pods:
1. **Delete pod-0**: You delete `web2-0`.
2. **Recreate**: Kubernetes creates a new Pod with the updated image.
3. **Delete pod-1**: Now, you delete `web2-1`.
4. **Recreate**: Kubernetes creates another new Pod.
5. **Delete pod-2**: Finally, you delete `web2-2`, and Kubernetes creates the last Pod.
In this case, you have more control, but your application may become unavailable during the update.

---

## Summary
- **RollingUpdate**: Ensures gradual updates and maintains application availability.
- **OnDelete**: Provides manual control over updates but may result in downtime.
The choice between these strategies depends on your application’s requirements and your need for control versus availability.

## Summary
- **OrderedReady**: Ideal for applications that require a specific order (e.g., databases), but slower.
- **Parallel**: Better for applications where order is not important, and speed is a priority.
The choice between these two depends on your application’s needs and your priorities.

# Understanding Partition in Kubernetes (StatefulSet)

The **Partition** concept in Kubernetes (especially in StatefulSets) is a feature that allows you to have more control over how Pods are updated. It is typically used with the **RollingUpdate** strategy and lets you specify which Pods should be updated and which should not.

## What is Partition?
- **Partition** is a number that tells Kubernetes from which Pod onward updates should be applied. Pods with an index **less than** this number will **not** be updated.
- This feature is particularly useful for controlling gradual updates and testing changes on a subset of Pods.

## Example:
Assume you have a StatefulSet with 5 Pods (`pod-0`, `pod-1`, `pod-2`, `pod-3`, `pod-4`) and you set the `partition` to `3`. In this case:
- Only Pods with an index **greater than or equal to 3** (i.e., `pod-3` and `pod-4`) will be updated.
- Pods with an index **less than 3** (i.e., `pod-0`, `pod-1`, `pod-2`) will **not** be updated.

## How to Use Partition:
In the StatefulSet manifest, you can specify the `partition` under the `updateStrategy` section. Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      partition: 3  # Only Pods with index >= 3 will be updated
```

## Use Cases for Partition:
1. **Testing Changes**: You can test new changes on a subset of Pods first and, if everything works well, update the rest of the Pods.

2. **Controlled Rollouts**: If you want updates to happen gradually and with more control, you can use Partition.

3. **Stability Checks**: By updating Pods incrementally, you can ensure that new changes do not cause issues in the system.

## Practical Example:
Assume you have a StatefulSet with 5 Pods and want to test new changes on pod-3 and pod-4 first. Here’s how it works:
1. Set the `partition` to `3`.
2. Kubernetes will only update `pod-3` and `pod-4`.
3. If the changes are successful, you can set the partition to 0 to update the remaining Pods.

## Important Notes:
1. If you set the `partition` to `0`, **all Pods** will be updated.
2. If you set the `partition` to a **number greater than the number of Pods, no Pods** will be updated.

## Summary:
* Partition is a powerful tool for controlling updates in StatefulSets.
* It allows you to perform updates gradually and in a controlled manner.
* This feature is particularly useful for testing changes and reducing risks associated with updates.

---

## Another Wxample with StorageClass
* When you have a `StorageClass` defined, you only need to use `volumeClaimTemplates` in your `StatefulSet`. Kubernetes will automatically create the corresponding `PVC` and `PV` for each replica.
* It’s important to note that data replication and consistency between database instances are handled internally by the MySQL application itself.
* In case of a pod crash or deletion, the associated PVC will persist (depending on the retention policy settings), and when the pod is recreated, the same PVC will be re-attached and mounted automatically.
