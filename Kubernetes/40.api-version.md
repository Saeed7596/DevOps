# **API Version in Kubernetes**  

In Kubernetes, different resources (such as **Pod, Deployment, Service**) are defined as **API Objects**, and each has its own **API Version**.  

---

### **API Version Structure in Kubernetes**  

API versions in Kubernetes follow this format:  

```
<group>/<version>
```
Or for core APIs:
```
<version>
```

Examples:  
- **Pods** → `v1`  *(No group, as it belongs to the Core API)*  
- **Deployments** → `apps/v1`  
- **NetworkPolicies** → `networking.k8s.io/v1`

### **API Version Types and Their Meaning**  

| **API Version**  | **Description** |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **alpha (e.g., v1alpha1)** | Experimental, unstable, may change. **Not recommended for production!** |
| **beta (e.g., v1beta1)** | More stable but still subject to changes. |
| **stable (e.g., v1)** | Fully stable and ready for production use. |

**Example:**  
- `networking.k8s.io/v1alpha1` → **Experimental version**  
- `apps/v1` → **Stable version**

### **How to Check API Version of a Resource?**  

🔹 To list all available API versions:  
```bash
kubectl api-versions
```

🔹 To check the API version of a specific resource:  
```bash
kubectl explain deployment | grep -i "API Version"
```

---

### **Summary**  
✅ Every Kubernetes resource has an **API Version**.  
✅ **Alpha** versions are unstable, **Beta** versions are somewhat stable, and **v1** is fully stable.  
✅ Use **kubectl api-versions** to check available API versions.
