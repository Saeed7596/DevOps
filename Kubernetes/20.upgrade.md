# OS Upgrade

```bash
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
### Before maintenance or removing a Node.
- Evacuates all regular Pods (except DaemonSets).
- Marks the Node as Unschedulable.
```bash
kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
```
### To temporarily stop scheduling new Pods on a Node.
- Existing Pods remain.
- Node becomes Unschedulable, but no Pods are evicted.
```bash
kubectl cordon <node-name> 
```
### To re-enable scheduling on a Node after an issue is resolved.
- Node becomes Schedulable again.
- New Pods can be scheduled on it.
```bash
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

# Cluster Upgrade
```bash
kubectl get nodes
# node names: controlplane, node01
kubectl describe nodes  controlplane | grep -i taint
# Taints:             <none>
kubectl describe nodes  node01 | grep -i taint
# Taints:             <none>
# This means that both nodes have the ability to schedule workloads on them.
kubeadm upgrade plan
kubectl drain controlplane --ignore-daemonsets
