# Deployments
#### Manages automated rollout, scaling, and updates of Pods.
```bash
kubectl get rs
kubectl get replicaset
kubectl get deploy
kubectl get deployment
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name>
kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>
kubectl explain deployment
```

---

```bash
nano nginx-deployment-definition.yaml
kubectl create -f nginx-deployment-definition.yaml
```
In the Deployment, the `spec` section will be for `Pods`.
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: nginx-frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: nginx-frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx
```
```bash
kubectl create deployment <deploy-name> --image=<image-name>
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml

kubectl scale deployment <deploy-name> --replicas=4
```

### **🔹 Deployment Strategies: Blue/Green & Canary**

#### **🚀 Blue/Green Deployment**
Blue/Green is a deployment strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical environments:
- **Blue**: The current, active version.
- **Green**: The new version that is tested before switching traffic.

📌 **Steps:**
1. Deploy the **Green** version alongside the **Blue** version.
2. Test the **Green** version.
3. Switch traffic from **Blue** to **Green** (typically by updating a Load Balancer).
4. If issues arise, revert back to **Blue**.

✅ **Pros:**
- Minimal downtime.
- Easy rollback.
- Ensures new version is fully tested before release.

❌ **Cons:**
- Requires double the resources.
- More complex infrastructure management.

#### **🛠 Canary Deployment**
Canary deployment is a progressive rollout strategy where the new version is deployed to a small subset of users before a full release.

📌 **Steps:**
1. Deploy the new version to a small percentage (e.g., 5%) of traffic/users.
2. Monitor performance and logs.
3. Gradually increase traffic if no issues are detected.
4. Fully roll out the new version if everything works well.

✅ **Pros:**
- Reduces risk of full failure.
- Allows real-world testing with minimal impact.
- Can be automated with monitoring tools.

❌ **Cons:**
- More complex traffic routing.
- Rollbacks require additional handling.

### **🔹 Conclusion**  
If you need to **filter or group resources**, use **Labels**.  
If you need to **store additional descriptive metadata**, use **Annotations**. 🚀  
For **deployment strategies**, use **Blue/Green** for instant switches and **Canary** for gradual rollouts.
