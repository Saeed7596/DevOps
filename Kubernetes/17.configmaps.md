# Configmaps
Stores key-value configuration data for Pods.

ConfigMap is a Kubernetes tool that allows you to manage application configurations separately from the main code. In simple terms, ConfigMap is a place where you can store information like environment variables, configuration files, or settings parameters and then inject this information into your applications.

---

## What is it Used For?
Imagine you have an application that needs information such as:
- Database URL
- Server port
- API keys
- Specific settings like Debug or Production mode

If you write this information directly into the application code, every time you need to change something, you have to modify the code and redeploy the application. This is time-consuming and makes the application code dependent on the settings. ConfigMap solves this problem. By using ConfigMap, you can keep the settings separate from the code and change them without needing to modify the code.

---

## Why Should We Use ConfigMap?
1. **Separation of Configuration from Code**:
   - This makes the application code cleaner and more maintainable.
2. **Simpler Configuration Management**:
   - You can easily change settings without redeploying the application.
3. **Usage in Different Environments**:
   - For example, you can have one ConfigMap for the Development environment and another for the Production environment.
4. **Enhanced Security**:
   - You can manage sensitive information like database URLs or API keys separately (though for highly sensitive information, it's better to use Secrets).

---

## When is it Good to Use ConfigMap?
- When application settings might change (e.g., database URL or server port).
- When you want to manage settings separately for different environments (Development, Staging, Production).
- When you want to run the application with new settings without changing the code.
- When you want to manage settings centrally and avoid duplicating information in multiple places.

---

## How Does ConfigMap Work?
ConfigMap injects information into the application in one of the following ways:
1. **As Environment Variables**:
   - Information from ConfigMap is injected as environment variables into the application.
2. **As Files Inside the Container**:
   - Information from ConfigMap is placed as files in a specified path inside the container.
3. **As Command-Line Arguments**:
   - You can pass ConfigMap information as arguments to the application.

---

## Advantages of ConfigMap
- **Simplicity and Flexibility**:
  - You can easily change and manage settings.
- **Separation of Configuration from Code**:
  - Makes the application code cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Support for Multiple Injection Methods**:
  - You can inject information as environment variables, files, or arguments.
- **Centralized Configuration Management**:
  - You can manage all settings in one centralized location.

---

## When Should You Not Use ConfigMap?
- **For Sensitive Information**:
  - ConfigMap is not suitable for storing sensitive information like passwords or API keys because the information in ConfigMap is not encrypted. For such cases, you should use Secrets.

---

## Summary
- ConfigMap is a tool for managing application settings separately from the code.
- It helps you change settings easily without needing to modify the code.
- You can use ConfigMap to inject settings into the application as environment variables, files, or arguments.
- For sensitive information, it's better to use Secrets.

## ConfigMap in Kubernetes can be used in two main ways:
### 1. As Environment Variables:
In this method, values stored in ConfigMap are injected into the application as environment variables. The application can read these variables and use them for its settings.

**Advantages**:
- Simple and fast for applications that support environment variables.
- No need to change the application code.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  APP_MODE: production
  APP_PORT: "8080"
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: my-app:latest
    env:
    - name: APP_MODE
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: app-config
          key: APP_MODE
    - name: APP_PORT
      valueFrom:
        configMapKeyRef:
          name: app-config
          key: APP_PORT
```
#### What does it do?
The environment variables `APP_MODE` and `APP_PORT` are injected from the ConfigMap into the container, and the application can use them.

---

### 2. As Files Inside the Container:
In this method, ConfigMap values are placed as files in a specified path inside the container. The application can read these files and use the values inside them.

**Advantages**:
- Suitable for applications that need configuration files.
- More flexibility for managing complex settings.
**Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  config.json: |
    {
      "mode": "production",
      "port": 8080
    }
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app-container
    image: my-app:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: app-config
```
#### What does it do?
The config.json file from the ConfigMap is copied to the path /etc/config/config.json inside the container, and the application can read it.

---

### When to Use Each Method?
* **Environment Variables:**
    - When settings are simple and small.
    - When the application supports environment variables.

* **Files Inside the Container:**
    - When settings are more complex (e.g., JSON or YAML files).
    - When the application needs configuration files.

---

## Summary
ConfigMap is used in two main ways in applications:
1. **As Environment Variables**: Simple and fast for small settings.
2. **As Files Inside the Container**: Suitable for complex settings and configuration files.

---

# Difference Between These Two Methods:

| Feature | Environment Variables (Environment Variables) |
|---|---|
| Simplicity | Simpler and faster for small settings. |
| Usage | For environment variables and simple settings. |
| Flexibility | Limited to environment variables. |
| Complexity | Simple and quick implementation. |
| Practical Example | Injecting values like port or application mode (production). |

---

## How:
- **Example 1**: (key:value): Suitable for simple settings and environment variables.
- **Example 2**: (file): Suitable for complex and structured configuration files.
