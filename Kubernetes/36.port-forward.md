# kubectl port-forward
The `kubectl port-forward` command is a quick and secure way to directly access Pods or Services within a Kubernetes cluster. This command is very useful for local testing, debugging, or temporary access to internal services.
```bash
kubectl port-forward <resource-type>/<resource-name> [local-port]:<remote-port> [options]
```
`[local-port]:<remote-port>`:

- **`local-port`**: The port on your local machine (localhost) that will be connected to the resource inside the cluster.
- **`remote-port`**: The port inside the resource (Pod or Service) where the desired service is running.

`[options]`: Optional flags that you can add to the command. Some common options include:

- **`-n <namespace>`**: Specify the namespace if the resource is in a different namespace.
- **`--address`**: The local IP address that the command should listen on (default is `localhost`).
```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/my-pod 8080:80
kubectl port-forward svc/my-service 8080:80

kubectl port-forward pod/my-pod 8080:80 -n my-namespace
kubectl port-forward pod/my-pod 8080:80 --address 192.168.1.100
```
### Stopping Port Forwarding:
To stop Port Forwarding, you can terminate the command by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

### After Running This Command:
- You can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
- Any request sent to `localhost:8080` will be forwarded to port `80` inside the Pod, and the response will be displayed to you.
