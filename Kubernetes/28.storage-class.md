# Storage Class
#### Defines different types of storage and allows dynamic provisioning.

A **Storage Class** in Kubernetes defines the type and properties of storage, such as disk speed, type, encryption, or IOPS. It is used to dynamically provision Persistent Volumes (PVs) for Pods.

### Key Components of a Storage Class:
- **Provisioner**: Specifies the provider (e.g., GCEPersistentDisk, AWS EBS).
- **Parameters**: Configuration options for the storage type (e.g., disk size, SSD/HDD).
- **ReclaimPolicy**: Defines what happens to the PV when it's deleted (e.g., Retain or Delete).
- **VolumeBindingMode**: Determines when the PV is bound to the Pod (immediate or lazy binding).

### Do You Need to Manually Create a Persistent Volume (PV)?
No, when using a **Storage Class**, Kubernetes automatically creates a PV when a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is made. You don't need to create a PV manually unless you have specific storage requirements that need to be handled manually. The Storage Class handles provisioning and management of the PV automatically.

```bash
kubectl get sc
kubectl describe sc local-storage
kubectl describe pvc local-pvc | grep -A3 Events
```
```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: local-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: local-storage
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: delayed-volume-sc
provisioner: kubernetes.io/no-provisioner
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```
