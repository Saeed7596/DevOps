# Taints and Tolerations
#### Restricts Pods from scheduling on certain nodes unless explicitly tolerated.
```bash
kubectl describe node node01 | grep -i taints
kubectl taint nodes node01 spray=mortein:NoSchedule
```
### with this yaml file this pod assign to node01
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: bee
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: bee
  tolerations:
  - key: spray
    value: mortein
    effect: NoSchedule
    operator: Equal
```
### node/controlplane untainted
```bash
kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule-
```

# 🔍 Summary 

| Effect           | New pod without tolerance | Old pod without tolerance | Severity  |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| NoSchedule       | ❌ It doesn't let         | ✔ Stays                  | High      |
| PreferNoSchedule | ⚠ He prefers not to       | ✔ Stays                  | Low       |
| NoExecute        | ❌ It doesn't let         | ❌ Deletes               | Very High |

* If you want someone to not put a pod on the infra by mistake, but you haven't forced it = Use `PreferNoSchedule`.
* If you want no pod to come unless it has tolerance = Use `NoSchedule`.
* If you want to eject a pod even if it is on the node = Use `NoExecute`.
