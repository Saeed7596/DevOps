# initContainer
- initContainer is for initial setup, while sidecar is used for ongoing tasks such as logging, proxying, and monitoring.
- initContainer runs before the main container starts.
- It is useful for checking prerequisites, downloading data, configuring settings, and waiting for other services to be ready.
- If an initContainer fails, the Pod will not start.
- Use a shared Volume to exchange data between the initContainer and the main container.
