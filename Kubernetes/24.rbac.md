# RBAC (Role-based Access Control)
### Key Components of RBAC:
- **Role and ClusterRole**:
  - **Role**: Used to define access at the Namespace level.
  - **ClusterRole**: Used to define access at the cluster-wide level.
- **RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding**:
  - **RoleBinding**: Binds a Role to a user, group, or service account within a specific Namespace.
  - **ClusterRoleBinding**: Binds a ClusterRole to a user, group, or service account across the entire cluster.

---

## Summary:
- **RBAC** is a tool for managing access in Kubernetes, providing security and fine-grained control.
- It has two main levels: **Namespace Scope** and **Cluster Scope**.
- With RBAC, you can define who (user or service) has access to what and what actions they can perform.
- It offers many advantages, such as high security and simplified management, but if not configured correctly, it can become complex.

# Practical Example: Granting Access to a User in Kubernetes
Let's create a user in Kubernetes, grant them access, and configure the necessary files so they can connect to the cluster. We'll use `Role`, `RoleBinding`, `Secret`, and the `kubeconfig` file. Finally, I'll explain how authentication works and how the user logs into the cluster.

---

## Scenario:
Assume you have a user named "Ali" who should only be able to view Pods in a specific Namespace (e.g., `team-a`) (read-only, no deletion or modification). Now, you want to set up this access from start to finish.

---

## Step 1: Create a ServiceAccount for the User
In Kubernetes, users or `ServiceAccounts` are used as "identities" to access the cluster. So, the first step is to create a ServiceAccount for our user.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: ali-sa
  namespace: team-a
```
### What does it do?
This file creates a ServiceAccount named `ali-sa` in the `team-a` Namespace. This ServiceAccount defines the identity of the user "Ali" in the cluster.

---

## Step 2: Create a Role to Limit Access
Now, we need to define the necessary permissions. The user should only be able to read Pods in the `team-a` Namespace, so we create a Role.
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: team-a
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```
### What does it do?
This Role allows anyone bound to it to:
* Read Pod information (`get`).
* List Pods (`list`).
* Watch Pod changes (`watch`).
* All of this is limited to the `team-a` Namespace.

---

## Step 3: Bind the Role to the ServiceAccount with RoleBinding
Now, we need to bind the Role to the `ali-sa` ServiceAccount so that the permissions defined in the Role are granted to this ServiceAccount.
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: pod-reader-binding
  namespace: team-a
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: ali-sa
  namespace: team-a
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```
### What does it do?
This file says, "Bind the `pod-reader` Role we defined to the `ali-sa` ServiceAccount in the `team-a` Namespace."

---

## Step 4: Get a Token from the ServiceAccount
Now that the ServiceAccount is created and bound to a Role, we need to get a Token from this ServiceAccount so the user can authenticate.

Command to get the Secret related to the ServiceAccount:
```bash
kubectl get secret -n team-a
```
Output:
```
NAME                        TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
ali-sa-token-abc123         kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      1m
```
View the Token content:
```bash
kubectl describe secret ali-sa-token-abc123 -n team-a
```
In the output, you'll see the JWT token. It looks something like this:
```
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Im... (a long string)
```
This Token is what the user "Ali" needs for authentication.

---

## Step 5: Create a kubeconfig File for the User
Now, we need to create a kubeconfig file for the user so they can connect to the cluster. This file stores cluster information, user details, and the Token.
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <CA_DATA> # Cluster certificate (Base64)
    server: https://<KUBERNETES_API_SERVER> # API server address
  name: my-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: my-cluster
    namespace: team-a # Restrict to a specific Namespace
    user: ali-user
  name: ali-context
current-context: ali-context
users:
- name: ali-user
  user:
    token: <ALI_TOKEN> # Ali's ServiceAccount Token
```
### Explanation:
* `certificate-authority-data`: This is the cluster certificate, which you can get using the command:
 - `kubectl config view --raw`
* `server`: The API server address of the cluster.
* `token`: The JWT token we got from the Secret.

---

## How Does Authentication Work in Kubernetes?
When the user "Ali" connects to the cluster using the kubeconfig file:

1. Authentication:
- Kubernetes checks the JWT token to ensure it is valid (issued by the ali-sa ServiceAccount).

2. Authorization:
- Kubernetes checks whether this ServiceAccount has permission to perform the requested action (e.g., reading Pods). This is done by checking the Role and RoleBinding.

---

## Step 6: How User Ali Uses the Access
1. Save the above file as `config`.
3. Tell user Ali to copy this file to the `~/.kube/config` path:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kube
cp config ~/.kube/config
```
3. Now, user Ali can run `kubectl` commands. For example:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n team-a
```
User Ali can now view the list of Pods in the `team-a` Namespace.

---

## Summary:
1. Create a ServiceAccount:
- To define the user's identity.

2. Define a Role:
- To specify permissions.

3. Create a RoleBinding:
- To bind the Role to the ServiceAccount.

4. Get a Token:
- For user authentication.

5. Create a kubeconfig:
- So the user can connect to the cluster.
