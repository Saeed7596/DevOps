# Control Plane Failure
If the control plane components are deployed as services, check the states of the services.
```bash
# On master nodes
service kube-apiserver status
service kube-scheduler status
service kube-controller-manager status
# On worker nodes
service kubelet status
service kube-proxy status
```
```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
kubectl describe pod -n kube-system <pod-name>
kubectl logs -n kube-system <pod-name>
# If any Control Plane Components encounter an error, you can fix them using the YAML files in this directory.
cd /etc/kubernetes/manifests

# if pod is pending
kubectl describe pod -n kube-system kube-scheduler-controlplane
nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml

# if scale up/down not working
kubectl describe pod -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-controlplane
kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-controlplane
nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
```

# Fix Kube-apiserver Access Issue with Proxy
When you configure a system-wide proxy, it might cause issues accessing the Kubernetes API server (`kube-apiserver`).
You may encounter errors such as 403 Forbidden, Connection Refused, or Timeout.

This usually happens because your requests to the API server are being routed through the proxy.

### Solution
You need to configure the `no_proxy` environment variable to bypass the proxy for localhost, 127.0.0.1, and the API server's IP or URL.

Example Command:
```bash
export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,<api-server-ip-or-url:6443>"
```
Replace <api-server-ip-or-url:6443> with your actual Kubernetes API server address and port.

Note:
- No space after the commas in the `no_proxy` list.
- You can also add other internal services (like etcd, internal load balancers) to this list if needed.

Optional
If you want this setting to persist across reboots or shell sessions, add the line to your shell config file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`) and reload it:
```bash
echo 'export no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,<api-server-ip-or-url:6443>"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
