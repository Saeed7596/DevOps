# Rolling Updates and Rollbacks
```bash
kubectl create -f nginx-deployment.yaml --record
# We can use the â€“ -record flag to save the command used to create/update a deployment against the revision number.
nano nginx-deployment.yaml # for example change image
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
# or
kubectl set image <resource-type> <resource-name> <container-name>=<new-image>
kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.25
# info
kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment
kubectl rollout history deployment nginx-deployment --revision=3
# undo
kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx-deployment --to-revision=1
# To rollback to specific revision we will use the --to-revision flag.
```
### Important Notes About Rollback

1. **Saving Version History**: Kubernetes, by default, only saves the history of the latest versions. If you want to store more versions, you need to set the `revisionHistoryLimit` in the Deployment. Example:
```yaml
spec:
  revisionHistoryLimit: 5
```
2. **CHANGE-CAUSE**: To record the reason for each change in the history, you can use `annotations`. Example:
```bash
kubectl annotate deployment <deployment-name> kubernetes.io/change-cause="Updated image to nginx:1.22"
```
You can also include CHANGE-CAUSE directly in the manifest. Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  namespace: devops
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/change-cause: "Updated image to nginx:1.22 for security fixes"
```

### RollingUpdate  
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: webapp
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
        name: simple-webapp
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```
### Recreate
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: default
spec:
  replicas: 4
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: webapp
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
        name: simple-webapp
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

**A Complete Example of Pause and Unpause**
Let's assume you have a Deployment named `nginx-deployment`. Now you want to change the Nginx version, but first, you want to pause it to make sure everything is correct.

**1. Pausing the Deployment**
First, you pause the Deployment so that Kubernetes does not apply the changes yet:
```bash
kubectl rollout pause deployment nginx-deployment
# deployment.apps/nginx-deployment paused
```
**2. Applying Changes**
Now, for example, you want to change the Nginx version from 1.22 to 1.23:
```Bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.23
# deployment.apps/nginx-deployment image updated
```
But since the Deployment is paused, Kubernetes saves this change but does not execute it yet.

**3. Checking the Status**
You want to make sure that the changes are done correctly and the Deployment is paused. Check the Deployment status:
```Bash
kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
# deployment "nginx-deployment" is paused
```
Here, Kubernetes tells you that your Deployment is in the paused state.

**4. Unpausing the Deployment**
When you are sure everything is okay, you unpause the Deployment:
```Bash
kubectl rollout resume deployment nginx-deployment
# deployment.apps/nginx-deployment resumed
```
Now Kubernetes will proceed with the rollout and apply the changes you made.

**5. Checking the Rollout Status**
If you want to see the rollout status, run this command:
```Bash
kubectl rollout status deployment nginx-deployment
# Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
# deployment "nginx-deployment" successfully rolled out
```
**Summary**
- `Pause`: Means telling Kubernetes, "Hold on for now, don't apply the changes."
- `Unpause`: Means telling Kubernetes, "Now apply the changes."
This feature allows you to make changes with more control and step-by-step.
