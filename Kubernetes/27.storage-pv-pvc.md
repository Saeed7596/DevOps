# Types of Storage in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, storage is divided into several categories, each designed for specific scenarios:

---

## 1. EmptyDir
**What is it?**
A temporary storage space that is created when a Pod is created and deleted when the Pod is removed.
**Where is it used?**
For storing temporary data that is only needed during the lifetime of the Pod.
**Example:**
Storing temporary files that do not need to be retained after the Pod is deleted.
**Advantages:**
- Very simple and fast.
**Disadvantages:**
- Data is lost when the Pod is deleted.
**emptyDir configuration example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.k8s.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /cache
      name: cache-volume
  volumes:
  - name: cache-volume
    emptyDir:
      sizeLimit: 500Mi
```

---

## 2. HostPath
**What is it?**
Storage space on the physical disk of the node where the Pod is running.
**Where is it used?**
For scenarios where data must remain on the same node, such as logs.
**Example:**
Storing application logs on the local disk of the node.
**Advantages:**
- Simple and straightforward.
**Disadvantages:**
- If the Pod is moved to another node, it loses access to the data.
**hostPath configuration example:**
```yaml
---
# This manifest mounts /data/foo on the host as /foo inside the
# single container that runs within the hostpath-example-linux Pod.
#
# The mount into the container is read-only.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hostpath-example-linux
spec:
  os: { name: linux }
  nodeSelector:
    kubernetes.io/os: linux
  containers:
  - name: example-container
    image: registry.k8s.io/test-webserver
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /foo
      name: example-volume
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: example-volume
    # mount /data/foo, but only if that directory already exists
    hostPath:
      path: /data/foo # directory location on host
      type: Directory # this field is optional
```

---

## 3. Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
**What is it?**
These are fundamental concepts for managing storage in Kubernetes:
- **PV (Persistent Volume)**: A persistent storage space defined independently.
- **PVC (Persistent Volume Claim)**: A request from an application to use a PV.
**Where is it used?**
For storing important and persistent data.
**Example:**
Storing database data (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB).
**Advantages:**
- Persistent and independent of Pods.
- Can be used with various storage backends (e.g., NFS, AWS EBS, GCP Persistent Disk).
**Disadvantages:**
- Requires more configuration.

---

## 4. ConfigMap and Secret
**What is it?**
For storing indirect data such as:
- **ConfigMap**: For storing application configurations.
- **Secret**: For storing sensitive data like passwords and API keys.
**Where is it used?**
For storing configurations and sensitive data.
**Example:**
Storing database passwords or server addresses.
**Advantages:**
- Secure and practical.
**Disadvantages:**
- Not suitable for large data.
**ConfigMap configuration example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: configmap-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: busybox:1.28
      command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "The app is running!" && tail -f /dev/null']
      volumeMounts:
        - name: config-vol
          mountPath: /etc/config
  volumes:
    - name: config-vol
      configMap:
        name: log-config
        items:
          - key: log_level
            path: log_level.conf
```

---

## 5. Cloud Volumes
**What is it?**
Storage that uses cloud services:
- AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- Azure Disk
- Google Cloud Persistent Disk
**Where is it used?**
For clusters running on the cloud.
**Example:**
Storing important database data on AWS EBS.
**Advantages:**
- Scalable and reliable.
**Disadvantages:**
- Only works on the cloud.

---

## 6. Network File System (NFS)
**What is it?**
A network-based storage space that can be accessed from multiple nodes.
**Where is it used?**
When multiple Pods need access to shared data.
**Example:**
Storing user-uploaded files.
**Advantages:**
- Shareable across nodes.
**Disadvantages:**
- May have slower performance.
**NFS configuration example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: registry.k8s.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /my-nfs-data
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    nfs:
      server: my-nfs-server.example.com
      path: /my-nfs-volume
      readOnly: true
```

## Components of Storage in Kubernetes

### Persistent Volume (PV):
- A storage resource defined by the admin.
- Like an independent storage space ready for use.

### Persistent Volume Claim (PVC):
- Applications use PVCs to request storage space.
- For example, an application might say: “I need 5 GB of storage.”

### Storage Class:
- A template for defining types of PVs.
- For example, you can say:
  - “Any PV using this Storage Class must be on SSD.”

---

## Summary:
- Kubernetes offers various storage options for different use cases:
  - **EmptyDir**: Temporary storage.
  - **HostPath**: Local node storage.
  - **PV/PVC**: Persistent storage.
  - **ConfigMap/Secret**: For configurations and sensitive data.
  - **Cloud Volumes**: Cloud-based storage.
  - **NFS**: Network-based shared storage.

# Storage Engine

The Storage Engine determines how data is stored and managed. Depending on your needs, you can use different types of Storage Engines:

- **File Storage**: For regular files.
- **Block Storage**: For databases and large volumes of data.
- **Object Storage**: For large and unstructured data.
- **Relational and NoSQL**: For structured or unstructured data.
- **In-Memory**: For high-speed access.
- **Distributed**: For scalability and large systems.

## Comparison of Storage Engine Types

| Storage Engine Type | Application | Disadvantages | Advantages |
|---|---|---|---|
| File Storage | Storing regular files like photos and documents | Difficult to manage at large scale | Simple and understandable |
| Block Storage | Databases and large volumes of data | Complex management | High speed |
| Object Storage | Storing large data like videos and backups | Slower speed compared to Block Storage | High scalability |
| Relational Storage | Relational databases like MySQL | Not suitable for large data | Suitable for structured data |
| NoSQL Storage | Unstructured data like logs | Limited support for complex queries | High scalability |
| In-Memory Storage | Cache and real-time systems | High cost, temporary data | Extremely high speed |
| Distributed Storage | Cloud systems and large data | Complex management | Scalability and fault tolerance |

# Persistent Volume (PV) & Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
- `PV`: Persistent volume configured by the administrator.
  It is independent of the Pod and is connected to the PVC.
- `PVC`: A request from a Pod to use a PV.
- A Pod cannot directly connect to a PV; it must use a PVC.
### Access Modes:             
- RWO - ReadWriteOnce
- ROX - ReadOnlyMany
- RWX - ReadWriteMany
- RWOP - ReadWriteOncePod
### Types of **Reclaim Policy**
1. **Retain**:
   - The PV and its data are retained, and the admin must manually decide what to do with them.
   - Example: For sensitive data that should not be automatically deleted.
2. **Recycle**:
   - The PV is automatically cleaned up (e.g., files are deleted) and made available again.
   - This method is no longer widely used.
3. **Delete**:
   - The PV and its stored data are completely deleted.
   - Example: For temporary or non-sensitive data.

| **Reclaim Policy** | **Description** | **Use Case** |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Retain**    | Keeps the PV and its data after PVC deletion, but the PV enters a **Released** state and requires manual cleanup. | When you want to preserve data and reuse the PV with a new PVC. |
| **Delete**    | Deletes the PV and its data when the PVC is deleted (if dynamically provisioned). | Suitable for cloud storage (AWS EBS, GCP PD) where storage should be freed. |
| **Recycle** *(Deprecated)* | Wipes the data (like `rm -rf /data/*`) and makes the PV available again. **(Removed in newer Kubernetes versions.)** | Used in older Kubernetes versions for PV resetting. |

#### Matching Based on Specifications (Binding)

Kubernetes automatically binds a PVC to a matching PV if the following specifications **match**:
- StorageClass (if used)
- Capacity (
  - The PV capacity can be greater than the requested PVC size, but it must not be smaller.
- Access Modes 
Binding PV to PVC
- When a PVC matches a PV, that PV gets bound to the PVC, and its status changes to Bound.

# Lifecycle in Persistent Volume (PV)
A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes has a defined lifecycle that includes various stages. These stages determine how a PV is created, used, and eventually released. The lifecycle of a PV is as follows:

---

## 1. Available
- When a PV is created and no application is using it, its status is **Available**.
- This means the PV is ready for use and waiting for a request (PVC) from an application.

---

## 2. Bound
- When an application creates a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and Kubernetes binds that PVC to a PV, the PV's status changes to **Bound**.
- In this state, the PV cannot be used by another application.

---

## 3. Using
- In this stage, the PV is actively being used by a Pod or application. This is part of the **Bound** stage but specifically refers to the time when data is being written to or read from the PV.

---

## 4. Released
- When the PVC is deleted or no longer needs the PV, the PV's status changes to **Released**.
- Note that the data inside the PV remains intact and must be manually cleaned up or managed by an admin.

---

## 5. Reclaimed
- If the admin decides to make the PV available again, they can clean up the previous data and return the PV to the **Available** state.
- This stage depends on the **Reclaim Policy**.

---

# Lifecycle in Storage Engine
The Storage Engine also has its own lifecycle, which determines how data is stored, managed, and eventually deleted. This lifecycle may vary slightly depending on the type of Storage Engine (e.g., File Storage, Block Storage, or Object Storage), but generally includes the following stages:

---

### 1. Provisioning
- In this stage, storage space is created. This can be done manually (Static Provisioning) or automatically (Dynamic Provisioning).
- Example: Creating a disk on AWS EBS or defining an NFS Share.

---

### 2. Allocation
- The storage space is allocated to an application or user.
- Example: When a PVC is bound to a PV.

---

### 3. Utilization
- In this stage, applications use the storage space. Data is written and read.
- Example: A MySQL database stores its data on a PV.

---

### 4. Deallocation
- When the application no longer needs the storage space, it is deallocated.
- Example: Deleting a PVC causes the PV to enter the **Released** state.

---

### 5. Deletion
- In this stage, the storage space and its data are completely deleted.
- Example: When the Reclaim Policy is set to **Delete**.

---

# Provisioning in Storage
## 1. Static Provisioning
**What is it?**
- The admin manually defines Persistent Volumes (PVs) and makes them available for use.
**Features**:
- Full control over storage space.
- Suitable for small environments.
**Disadvantages**:
- Requires manual management.
- Time-consuming for large environments.

---

## 2. Dynamic Provisioning
**What is it?**
- Kubernetes automatically creates PVs based on Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).
**Features**:
- Automated management.
- Suitable for large and dynamic environments.
**Disadvantages**:
- Requires initial setup for the Provisioner.

---

## Summary
- **Lifecycle in PV**:
  - Determines how a PV is created, used, and released. This lifecycle includes the stages: **Available**, **Bound**, **Released**, and **Reclaimed**.
- **Lifecycle in Storage Engine**:
  - Determines how data is stored, managed, and deleted. This lifecycle includes the stages: **Provisioning**, **Allocation**, **Utilization**, **Deallocation**, and **Deletion**.
- **Provisioning**:
  - Can be done manually (Static) or automatically (Dynamic).
