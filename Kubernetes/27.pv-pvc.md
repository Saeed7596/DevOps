# Persistent Volume (PV) & Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)
- `PV`: Persistent volume configured by the administrator.
  It is independent of the Pod and is connected to the PVC.
- `PVC`: A request from a Pod to use a PV.
- A Pod cannot directly connect to a PV; it must use a PVC.
### Access Modes:             
- RWO - ReadWriteOnce
- ROX - ReadOnlyMany
- RWX - ReadWriteMany
- RWOP - ReadWriteOncePod
### Types of **Reclaim Policy**
- Retain -- manual reclamation
- Recycle -- basic scrub (rm -rf /thevolume/*)
- Delete -- delete the volume

| **Reclaim Policy** | **Description** | **Use Case** |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Retain**    | Keeps the PV and its data after PVC deletion, but the PV enters a **Released** state and requires manual cleanup. | When you want to preserve data and reuse the PV with a new PVC. |
| **Delete**    | Deletes the PV and its data when the PVC is deleted (if dynamically provisioned). | Suitable for cloud storage (AWS EBS, GCP PD) where storage should be freed. |
| **Recycle** *(Deprecated)* | Wipes the data (like `rm -rf /data/*`) and makes the PV available again. **(Removed in newer Kubernetes versions.)** | Used in older Kubernetes versions for PV resetting. |

#### Matching Based on Specifications (Binding)

Kubernetes automatically binds a PVC to a matching PV if the following specifications **match**:
- StorageClass (if used)
- Capacity (
  - The PV capacity can be greater than the requested PVC size, but it must not be smaller.
- Access Modes 
Binding PV to PVC
- When a PVC matches a PV, that PV gets bound to the PVC, and its status changes to Bound.
