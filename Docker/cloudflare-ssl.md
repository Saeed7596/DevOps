# NGINX Configuration with Cloudflare SSL (Flexible Mode)

This guide explains how to set up NGINX to use Cloudflare’s SSL without requiring an SSL certificate on your server. By enabling **Flexible SSL** on Cloudflare, HTTPS traffic will be secured between the user and Cloudflare, while HTTP will be used between Cloudflare and your server.

---

## 1. Add Your Domain to Cloudflare (If Not Already Done)

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Add Site** and enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
3. Choose a Cloudflare plan and continue with the setup.
4. Follow the instructions to update your domain’s nameservers to the ones provided by Cloudflare. 

---

## 2. Create a DNS Record for the Subdomain

1. In your Cloudflare dashboard, go to your domain’s **DNS** settings.
2. Click **Add Record** and enter the following details:

   - **Type**: Select **A** if pointing to an IP address, or **CNAME** if pointing to another domain.
   - **Name**: `@` (This represents the root domain, like `example.com`)
   - **Name**: Enter the subdomain (e.g., `subdomain` for `subdomain.example.com`).
   - **IPv4 address**: Enter the server’s IP address if using an A record.
   - **Proxy Status**: Set to **Proxied** (orange cloud icon) to enable CDN and SSL.

3. Click **Save**.

## 3. Enable SSL and CDN

1. Go to the **SSL/TLS** section in Cloudflare’s dashboard.
2. Set the SSL mode to **Flexible**. This mode encrypts traffic between users and Cloudflare, but not between Cloudflare and your origin server.
3. Cloudflare CDN is now active, as indicated by the **Proxied** setting on the DNS record.

> **Note:** Flexible SSL mode does not require an SSL certificate on your server. If you need full end-to-end encryption, consider switching to **Full SSL** (requires an SSL certificate on your server).

---

## 4. Verify Cloudflare CDN and SSL Are Active

1. Once DNS propagation completes (usually within a few minutes to an hour), your subdomain (`subdomain.example.com`) should be accessible over HTTPS.
2. To confirm Cloudflare is serving the content, inspect the response headers. You should see headers such as `cf-cache-status` and `server: cloudflare`, which indicate Cloudflare is active.

---

With these steps, Cloudflare is set up to provide both SSL and CDN for your subdomain.

---

## 5. Configure NGINX to Listen on Port 80 Only

Since Cloudflare handles SSL, you only need to configure NGINX to listen on port 80 (HTTP) and proxy the traffic to your Docker container.

### Example NGINX Configuration

Replace `example.com` with your subdomain and `172.17.0.1:3033` with the IP address and port of your Docker container.
```nginx
# Redirect to the non-www version
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.example.com;
    return 301 $scheme://example.com$request_uri;
}
```
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    client_max_body_size 32M;

    location / {
        proxy_read_timeout      300;
        proxy_connect_timeout   300;
        proxy_redirect          off;

        proxy_set_header        Host                $http_host;
        proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP           $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For     $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto   http;
        proxy_set_header        X-Frame-Options     SAMEORIGIN;
        proxy_pass http://172.17.0.1:<port-number>;
    }
}
```
# Restart nginx
```bash
docker compose -f docker-nginx.yml restart nginx
```
# Redirect www to Non-www Domain Using Cloudflare

This document explains how to set up a redirect from `www.example.com` to `example.com` using Cloudflare, without needing additional configuration in NGINX.

---

## 1. Set Up DNS in Cloudflare

1. **Login to Cloudflare**: Go to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) and log in to your account.
2. **Select Domain**: Choose the domain (e.g., `example.com`) you want to configure.
3. **Go to DNS Settings**: In the Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to the **DNS** tab.
4. **Add CNAME Record for `www`**:
   - Add a new **CNAME** record for `www`:
     - **Type**: `CNAME`
     - **Name**: `www`
     - **Target**: `example.com` (your main domain)
     - **Proxy Status**: Set to **Proxied** (orange cloud icon)

This DNS setup ensures that any traffic hitting `www.example.com` is redirected to `example.com`.

---

## 2. Use Cloudflare Page Rules for Redirect

1. **Go to Page Rules**: In the Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to the **Page Rules** tab.
2. **Create a New Page Rule**:
   - Click on **Create Page Rule**.
   - Set the URL pattern to `www.example.com/*` (replace `example.com` with your domain).
   - Choose **Forwarding URL** as the setting.
   - Select **301 - Permanent Redirect** and set the destination URL to `https://example.com/$1` (this ensures that the path and query string are preserved).
3. **Save and Deploy**: Click **Save and Deploy** to apply the changes.

---

## 3. Verify Cloudflare Configuration

- **Wait for DNS Propagation**: It may take a few minutes to an hour for DNS changes to propagate.
- **Check Redirect**: After propagation, when you visit `www.example.com`, it should automatically redirect to `example.com`.
- **Confirm CDN and SSL**: Check that Cloudflare’s CDN and SSL are active for the redirected domain using tools like browser DevTools or `curl`.

---

## 4. Is NGINX Configuration Needed?

If you have set up the redirect using **Cloudflare Page Rules**, you **do not need** to configure the redirect in **NGINX**. Cloudflare handles the redirect, and there is no need to duplicate this in NGINX.

If you were not using Cloudflare for the redirect, you would need to configure NGINX to handle the redirect, but with Cloudflare, it's not necessary.

---

## Conclusion

By using Cloudflare's **Page Rules** and **DNS settings**, you can easily manage the redirect from `www` to `non-www` without additional configuration in your NGINX server. This ensures that Cloudflare handles the redirect efficiently, along with SSL and CDN for better security and performance.
